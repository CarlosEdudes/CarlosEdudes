- 👋 Hi, I’m @CarlosEdudes, I'm from Brazil and 19 years old.
- 👀 I am interested in learning and working as a Full Stack developer and passionate about AI (Artificial Intelligence) innovation following these two areas as a career in the not too distant future.
- 🌱 I'm learning Full Stack as Front-End the languages of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, as Back-End the programming languages in PHP, PYTHON and MYSQL, in frameworks and libraries are REACT.JS, NODE.JS and LARAVEL, as Cloud services will be AQW, G CLOUD and MS AZURE and fully dominate GIT & GITHUB.
- 💞️ I seek to collaborate with programming, learn about, and get to know the world of AI
